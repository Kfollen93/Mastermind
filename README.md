# Mastermind

A game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns. Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct number but in the wrong space.

You can play the game online in a REPL here: [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Kfollen93/Mastermind)](https://repl.it/github/Kfollen93/Mastermind)
